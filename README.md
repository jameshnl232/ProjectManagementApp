## Project Management Web Application Overview:

- This project management web application leverages a full-stack approach to deliver a robust and scalable solution. On the back-end, it's built with Node.js and Express, managing data through a Postgres database, with Prisma ORM streamlining database interactions. The front-end is powered by Next.js, offering a seamless user experience, with state management efficiently handled via Redux Toolkit. Tailwind CSS and Material-UI (MUI) are used for responsive and elegant design components, while React DnD and Recharts facilitate intuitive drag-and-drop functionality and interactive data visualizations.

- The application is deployed on AWS, using AWS Cognito for user authentication and Postman for API testing, with AWS CLI for infrastructure management. Gantt charts provide detailed project timelines, integrating well with other dynamic features.
